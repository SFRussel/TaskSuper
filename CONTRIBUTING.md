# Contributing to TaskFlow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TaskFlow! This guide will help you get started with our team collaboration workflow.

## üå≥ Branch Strategy

We follow a feature branch workflow:

```
main (production-ready code)
  ‚Üì
develop (integration branch)
  ‚Üì
feature/your-feature (your work)
```

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local repository
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/task-modal-improvements

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/drag-drop-issue
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/notification-system`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/login-validation`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/auth-service`)
- `style/` - UI/styling changes (e.g., `style/task-card-design`)
- `docs/` - Documentation (e.g., `docs/api-documentation`)

## üìù Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages following this format:

```
Type: Brief description

Detailed explanation (if needed)
```

### Commit Types

- `Add:` - New feature or file
- `Update:` - Modify existing functionality
- `Fix:` - Bug fix
- `Remove:` - Delete code or files
- `Refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `Style:` - Formatting, styling changes
- `Docs:` - Documentation changes
- `Test:` - Adding or updating tests

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "Add: Drag and drop reordering for tasks"
git commit -m "Fix: Profile picture upload not working on Safari"
git commit -m "Update: Improve task card hover animations"
git commit -m "Refactor: Simplify authentication service logic"
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Before Starting Work**
   - Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplicate work
   - Discuss major changes in an issue first
   - Assign yourself to the issue you're working on

2. **While Working**
   - Keep your branch up to date with develop
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Test your changes thoroughly

3. **Submitting a PR**
   ```bash
   # Push your branch
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   
   # Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
   # Select: base: develop <- compare: feature/your-feature
   ```

4. **PR Description Template**
   ```markdown
   ## What does this PR do?
   Brief description of changes
   
   ## Type of change
   - [ ] New feature

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

Before submitting a PR, test the following:

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Register new user
- [ ] Login with credentials
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Error handling (wrong password, etc.)

## üö´ Merge Conflict Resolution

If you encounter merge conflicts:

```bash
# 1. Update your branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/your-feature
git merge develop

# 2. Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Look for markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>

# 3. After resolving
git add .
git commit -m "Merge: Resolve conflicts with develop"
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### Common Conflict Areas
- **styles.css** - Coordinate CSS changes
- **firebase.js** - Don't modify without team discussion
- **package.json** - Communicate new dependencies

## üí¨ Communication

### Before Making Changes
- Comment on the issue you're working on
- Discuss significant changes in team chat
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear

### During Development
- Push commits regularly (at least daily)
- Update issue with progress
- Ask for help if stuck for >2 hours

### After Completion
- Request review from specific team member
- Be responsive to feedback
- Help others review when tagged

## üìã Code Style Guidelines

### React Components
```javascript
// Use functional components with hooks
const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(null);
  
  // Event handlers
  const handleClick = () => {
    // logic
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="my-component">
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### CSS
```css
/* Use kebab-case for class names */
.task-card {
  /* Properties in alphabetical order */
  background: var(--white);
  border-radius: var(--radius);
  padding: 16px;
}

/* Use CSS variables for colors */
color: var(--primary);
```

### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (TaskCard.js)
- Services: camelCase (authService.js)
- CSS: kebab-case (task-card.css)
